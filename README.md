# CS300-Final-Project

***What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?***
The client for our project, ABC University (ABCU) required a software that would help advisors access course information for students. For this problem, students were tasked with creating a course catalog that allowed the user to display all the courses in alphabetical order, load courses from a CSV file, and find a course to display its unique information within a data structure.

***How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.***
I approached the problem by creating pseudocode to determine the best data structure for this project. The pseudocode captured all the requirements of the software and allowed me to perform runtime analysis on each of the three structures I had chosen from. I had started with a vector, then a hash table, and finally, a binary search tree. It was important to understand these data structures as each has specific areas of strengths and weaknesses and can vary in big o notation when it comes to different functions within the software.

***How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?***
I initially had trouble getting an IDE that ran smoothly on my computer and had a version of C++11 to use the auto feature present in the starting code. I overcame this by researching different IDEs and which would be best for what I was trying to accomplish with the activities and projects. I also faced some issues when creating the different algorithms for our assignments as they were set up a little differently from the book. I used a variety of resources such as unit testing, tutoring services, and different algorithm examples to successfully resolve these issues.

***How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?***
Because of not only this project, but the class as a whole, I have learned the importance of providing the best data structures to a given situation. I have also learned how to perform runtime analysis and how crucial it is to the efficiency and functionality of the system. Furthermore, I now understand how to consider best, worst and average cases when deciding on how to layout my code. I plan to use what I have learned to become more familiar with even more data structures and learn how I can develop programs and software that meets the best scenario for run-time and memory usage.

***How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?***
Because of this class, I have gained a better understanding of the importance of creating modular code that is reusable. I also understand how crucial accurate and concise in-line comments can be for readability of the program. Finally, I am now more confident in deciding what data structures to implement in a program based on different cases and the inputs that would be used for the operations of the program.
